## HOW IT WORKS

OpenMapKit (OMK) is an extension of OpenDataKit allowing users to create professional quality mobile data collection surveys for field data collection.

OpenMapKit launches directly from OpenDataKit when the OSM question type is enabled in a standard survey. Simply include OSM questions and tags in your survey to collect information on OSM in the field.

Traditional field data collection tools for OpenStreetMap have either relied on paper or are too complicated, targeted at GIS professionals, or lack an understanding of traditional survey techniques. As new projects such as Missing Maps and other humanitarian field data collection projects focus on field data collection the need for a structured, yet simple, OpenStreetMap field data collection tool became apparent. OpenMapKit serves this need.
