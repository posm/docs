.. todo:: Need to revise and add more details to this section.

Humanitarian principles guide our work.

The IFRC has embarked on a consistent and inspirational approach to promoting humanitarian values and the `seven Fundamental Principles <http://www.ifrc.org/en/who-we-are/vision-and-mission/the-seven-fundamental-principles/>`_ of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.

Various other documents provide good guidance:

- `Signal code <https://signalcode.org/>`_
- `General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <https://eugdpr.org/>`_ of the EU

Ethical best practices should be followed for the use of technology even when regulations or other legal frameworks are not in place to mandate it.
